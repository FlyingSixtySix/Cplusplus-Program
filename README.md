# System Analysis and Design

## Client Summary

DriverPass, the client, is a company that wants to provide better driver training. The system I was tasked with designing was a cloud-based website that allows interactions from the DMV, IT administrators, drivers, secretaries, and users.

## What I did particularly well

Detailing specifics about the system, such as it running on Linux. If I had more information about *specific* requirements, I could have detailed this more, but I don't expect it to be too complex for this course.

## Choosing one part to revise

The use case diagram could use more detail, though I have to balance putting in too much detail and not enough detail. I feel like I didn't convey the DMV's role or driver's role enough in the diagram.

## Interpreting user needs

I interpreted the user needs by reviewing the interview transcript across multiple sessions to ask myself whether what was said was meant to be interpreted exactly as-is, or if there were any further implications beyond that with a safe enough connection to make an assumption on. Understanding user needs is important because it is the entire purpose you are designing that system.

## How I approach designing software

Start off talking directly with the client and figuring out a list of all the needs. Then start connecting the dots, with a use case diagram (for example). The rest should fall in place after that. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification.
