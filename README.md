## How I approach designing software

For the most part, when I work on designing new software, I aim to streamline the process of development by implementing modular code.  I made sure to apply industry standards for designing software applications, meaning it can easily be applied in future work.

## How I approach developing programs

Like before, I develop by using modular code.  First development starts out as a simple 1-2-3 step process, but as the software grows, it becomes necessary at a certain point to modularize code as best as I can.  There is such thing as being *too* modular, which I did my best to avoid in this class.  I iterated with different modular designs over this course, leading to a better overall design.  Through the milestones, I learned about different OpenGL techniques that I wasn't aware of before, broadening my knowledge, which is always a good thing!

## How computer science helps me in reaching my goals

With basic knowledge of computational graphics and visualization, I can fairly easily render what I have in mind when it comes to something more specific, because while there are certain 3D applications that can handle the generic part of the process for me, nothing will beat writing the mechanics and software process behind rendering EXACTLY what I had in mind.  I don't see too much of a difference between applying the skills learned here in an educational context nor professional context, but it's good to have none the less.
