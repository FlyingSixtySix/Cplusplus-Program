# The Gaming Room

## Summary

The Gaming Room wishes to adapt their game, Draw It or Lose It, for the web.  They asked for a design document covering the design constraints, system architecture view, domain model, evaluation, and recommendations regarding the operating platform they should host their game on.

## What was done particularly well

While I feel like I lacked in the recommendations as I was sidetracked when I completed them and had to submit as it was so late, the piece I was proud of was the domain model provided.  It gives a clear explanation of the back-end system used to handle games, teams, players, and entities.

## Helpful processes

Having an explanation of what I needed to work on and having a UML diagram showing more specifically what needed worked on helped tremendously.

## Revision

I would revise the recommendations.  I do not feel like they were clear enough, but I feel as though developing for a Linux back-end and multi-platform front-end would have been too much to recommend.

## User needs interpretation

I was provided with an explanation of their current development situation, which helped me pick from my knowledge what system would have worked best for them.  When developing software and platforms, it's more productive to have a platform that works best for the developers.  Providing recommendations with a softer learning curve is what I believe helps most.

## Approach

Creating a design document for every single one of my hobby projects would be too much effort, but if I were developing in a professional capacity, I would consider doing it as it provides a great outline--it's a great strategy.
