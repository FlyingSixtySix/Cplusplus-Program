# Current/Emerging Trends in CS

## What code was I given? What code did I create myself?

I was given most of the code in this course, but I was able to implement a solution to the cartpole problem and write the code that handles the treasure hunt model and the training process of it.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

From my understanding, computer scientists study and progress the science of computer systems, and it matters because computers make up an incredibly large part of society, from utilities to entertainment.  We are seeking progress to make those systems more efficient to hopefully serve society in a positive way.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer science?

I avoid duplicate effort while still learning while I can.  A majority of problems that I've run into can be solved like building blocks, where pieces of code or software can be put together to form a larger, unique solution for me.  It really depends.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

This is a broad question, but I like the sentiment of *do no evil.*  I like making code that *works* and serves to benefit both the end user and the organization, with heavy preference toward the end user.
