# Emerging Sys Arch & Tech

## Project

The main project for CS-350 involved making a heater controller/thermostat that would turn on a heater if it fell below the set temperature.  The temperature could be adjusted up or down a degree (in celsius) with two of the buttons on the CC3220x-LAUNCHXL.

## What I did particularly well

I worked on my code iteratively and debugged with the tools at my full disposal, allowing me to accomplish all programming tasks on the same day, within a few hours in most cases.

## Where I could improve

Error handling seemed practically non-existent, with errors simply looping forever instead of taking further action.  Though, I suppose there isn't much that can actually be done.

## What tools and/or resources I added to my support network

I didn't add anything in particular, but my love for Stack Overflow and in-code documentation has strengthened.  Thank you, developers before me!  I hope to live up to their expectations and document my code even better.

## Transferable skills

Iterative development and debugging are the two largest ones.  Anything else will come naturally.

## Making this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable

Modularization of code, commenting where necessary (NO OVER-COMMENTING), and coming up with straight-forward code solutions to problems.
