# Software Testing Automation & QA

## How I ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure

To me, the most important aspect is following good software development standards.  This broadly means following industry standards depending on the language, framework, and other code aspects, but this can also mean following the standards used in the specific environment (like a company that limits third-party library usage).  Staying on top of security news and performing audits on the code can go a long way towards ensuring the code is functional and secure.

## How I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program

Prioritize certain features as necessary, giving user stories a rank based on how important they might be.  This is typically the job of the project manager or someone who meets with the client(s), however.  Working alone, incorporating the large features first followed by the smaller features allows for you to not get overwhelmed with specific things to test until it's necessary.

## How I approach designing software

A software design document helps when working in a team, but alone, it's unorganized for the most part.  I struggle with keeping my software development lifecycle organized.  Perhaps something I can do is make a prioritized todo list with as many relevant/necessary features I can think of and work on them one-by-one, implementing tests as necessary.
